I am guilty
Ashamed of what I've done, what I've become
I dare not lift them up to the Holy one


You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome

You gave Your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free
How can it be
How can it be


I've been hiding
Afraid I've let ou down inside I doubt
That You still love me
But in Your eyes there's only grace now


You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome

You gave Your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free
How can it be
How can it be


Though I fall, You can make me new
From this death I will rise with You
Oh the grace reaching out for me
How can it be
How can it be


You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome

You gave Your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free


You plead my cause
You right my wrongs
You break my chains
You overcome

You gave Your life
To give me mine
You say that I am free
How can it be
How can it be
