This world is not my home I'm just a passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels becon me from Heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Oh Lord, You know, I have no friend like You
If Heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do?
The angels becon me from Heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

They're all expecting me and that's one thing I know
My savior pardoned me and now I onward go
I konw He'll take me through though I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

O Lord, You know, I have no friend like You
If Heaven's not my home then Lord what will do?
The angels becon me from Heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Just up in Glory Land we'll live eternally
The Saints on every hand are shouting victory
Their song of sweetest praise drifts back from Heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

O Lord, You know, I have no friend like You
If Heaven's not my home then Lord what will do?
The angels becon me from Heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
