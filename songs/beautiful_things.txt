All this pain
I wonder if I'll ever find my way
I wonder if my life could really change, at all

All this Earth
Could all that is lost ever be found?
Could a garden come out from this ground, at all?

You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of the dust
You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of us

All around,
Hope is springing up from this old ground
Out of chaos life is being found, in you

You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of the dust
You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of us

Oh, You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of the dust
You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of us

You make me new,
You are making me new
You make me new,
You are making me new
(making me new)

You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of the dust
You make beauiful things 
You make beauiful things out of us

Oh, You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of the dust
You make beauiful things
You make beauiful things out of us

You make me new,
You are making me new
You make me new,
You are making me new
