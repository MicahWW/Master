I've heard a thousand stories
of what you're like
But I've heard the tender whispers
of love in the dead of night
And you tell me that you're pleased
And that I'm never alone


You're a good good Father
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are
And I'm loved by you
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am


I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching
For answers only you provide
Cause you know just what we need
Before we say a word


You're a good good Father
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are
And I'm loved by you
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am


Because You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways to us

You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways to us


Oh, it's love so undeniable
I, I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable
I, I can hardly think

As you call me deeper still
As you call me deeper still
As you call me deeper still
Into love, love, love


You're a good good Father
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are
And I'm loved by you
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am
2x


You are perfect in all of your ways
It's who You are, It's who You are, It's who You are
And I'm loved by You
You are perfect in all of Your ways
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am
