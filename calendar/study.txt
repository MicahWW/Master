1. decimal to BCD
		a) BCD to dec is like hex to binary
		b) BCD numbers can only represent numbers 0 to 9
		ex: 592 base 10 to BCD
			5	9	2
			0101	1001	0010
2. a little DeMorgan's
3. use NAND and NOR gates only to form a circuit
	i) look over the conversions of gates to NAND and NOR
		a) pictures of converstions are in OneDrive
4. K-maps
		a) circling ones:	produces a sum of products (aka: AB + AC)
		b) circling zeros:	produces a product of sums (aka: [A + B][C + A])
5. VHDL code
	i)  look at syntax
	ii) decelration
